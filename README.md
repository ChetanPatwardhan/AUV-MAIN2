# Autonomous Underwater Vehicle
**Description**

     Mission Editor :
–	 Designed  an intuitive interface to plan, create, and edit AUV missions, including payload and device management with real-time parameter customization.

     Live Tracking :
–	 Developed a real-time tracking system for AUVs, enabling monitoring of navigation parameters like latitude, longitude, pitch, roll, and pressure with seamless data visualization.

    Replay :
–	Built  a replay interface to analyze historical AUV data, supporting dynamic playback with time-tracking controls and generating detailed performance reports.

    Microcontroller Integration :
–		 Programmed and integrated microcontrollers  STM32 and Raspberry Pi Pico to control servo motors, sensors, and other hardware components critical to AUV functionality.
